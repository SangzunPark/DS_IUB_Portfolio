    "\n",
    "The pre-trained GPT-2 tokenizer splits the text into smaller units (tokens).\n",

    "Role of the TokenChunker:\n",
    "\n",
    "The TokenChunker groups the tokens split by the tokenizer into chunks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Chunk: Outputs the text chunk itself.\n",
    "The result shows that the input text is processed as a single chunk.\n",
    "Tokens: Outputs the number of tokens within the chunk.\n",
    "It indicates that the input text is split into 24 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it processed as a single chunk?\n",
    "By default, the TokenChunker sets criteria for dividing the text into chunks. These criteria can be based on a fixed number of tokens, words, sentences, etc.\n",
    "Since there was no explicit setting for chunk size in the code, the entire text appears to have been processed as a single chunk.\n",
    "For instance, if the chunk size had been set, the text might have been divided into smaller chunks."

    "**SemanticChunker** is a tool that divides text based on syntactic and semantic criteria. While traditional chunking tools split text based on simple metrics such as word count, sentence count, or token count, SemanticChunker analyzes the meaning and context of the text to segment it into appropriate units. This tool is particularly useful for dividing long documents into sections based on topics.\n"
