# 03_Visualization – Analysis of Apartment Rental Prices in Germany

This project analyzes apartment rental prices across Germany using data visualization techniques.  
The analysis is designed to be intuitive and visually memorable, rather than overly complex.

---

##  Objectives

- Understand regional rental price trends across Germany
- Visualize the influence of various factors (e.g., location, size, year)
- Help users naturally become familiar with German geography through visual storytelling

---

##  Project Structure

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Clean and summarize rental price data
   - Examine distributions and outliers

2. **Geospatial Data Integration**  
   - Use `GeoPandas` to map rental data to German administrative regions

3. **Visualization**  
   - Create intuitive plots:
     - Regional choropleth maps
     - Bar plots of average rental prices by state
     - Heatmaps, boxplots, and correlation analyses
