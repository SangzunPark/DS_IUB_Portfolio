# Python Basics â€“ K-means Implementation (Pure Python)

This folder contains a step-by-step implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm using pure Python.

## Files

- `project_phase_1.py`: Load data, replace missing values, and compute basic statistics and histograms.
- `project_phase_2.py`: Implement K-means clustering with centroid initialization and iteration logic.
- `project_phase_3.py`: Add evaluation of cluster accuracy by comparing to true class labels.

##  Dataset

- Dataset: [breast-cancer-wisconsin.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original))
- Features: A2 ~ A10
- Target: Class (2 or 4)

##  Highlights

- Manual calculation of Euclidean distance
- Custom cluster assignment logic
- Accuracy evaluation using predicted vs. actual classes
